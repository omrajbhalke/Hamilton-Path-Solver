# Hamilton-Path-Solver-A-Gamified-Approach-to-Graph-Theory
This project focuses on solving Hamilton Path problems in graph theory, offering three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level presents users with unique challenges, such as navigating through simple graphs with fewer vertices (Easy) to solving intricate, complex graphs (Hard).

Here's a **README** template for your project:

# **Hamilton Path Solver**

## **Overview**
Hamilton Path Solver is an interactive web application designed to help users explore and solve Hamilton Path problems in graph theory. It provides challenges at three difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**, making it suitable for learners of all skill levels. The project uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to deliver an engaging and user-friendly experience.

## **Features**
- **Three Difficulty Levels**:  
  - **Easy**: Simple graphs with fewer vertices and edges.  
  - **Medium**: Moderately complex graphs to challenge users.  
  - **Hard**: Intricate graphs with significant complexity for advanced users.  

- **Interactive Graph Visualizations**: Dynamically explore and visualize graphs.  
- **Gamified Elements**: Scoring system and real-time feedback for user engagement.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for seamless navigation.

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: Structure and content of the application.  
- **CSS**: Styling for a visually appealing interface.  
- **JavaScript**: Logic for graph generation, user interaction, and solution validation.

## **Installation and Usage**
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hamilton-path-solver.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd hamilton-path-solver
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the application.

---

## **How It Works**
1. Select a difficulty level (**Easy**, **Medium**, or **Hard**).  
2. A graph is generated for the selected difficulty.  
3. Try to find a Hamilton Path by interacting with the graph.  
4. Submit your solution to check if itâ€™s correct.  
5. Get feedback and try new challenges!
